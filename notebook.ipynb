    "In this code-along, we will be building an AI Movie Night Recommendation Tool! \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we will be using two data sets: \n",
    "- Movies metadata: A data set containing metadata of about 9000 movies (title, description, etc.)\n",
    "- User ratings: A data set containing ratings of how much someone liked a movie. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be building towards our end goal by covering the following tasks: \n",
    "- Understanding the data set by doing some basic exploratory analysis \n",
    "- Building a first recommender based on movie popularity or movie ratings \n",
    "- Personalising recommendations by exploiting user ratings \n",
    "- Leveraging LLMs to calculate similarity between movies \n",
    "- Generating a recommendation by writing what kind of movies you'd like to see \n",
    "- Putting it all together into one single recommendation tool\n",
    "\n",
    "This code-along is aimed at anyone just starting to code by showing how you can build something useful by simply writing prompts to analyse data sets. The code generated is sufficiently challenging, however, for the more seasoned data person to play around with."
